Our code for this problem is distributed across extractFeatures.m and touch.py

The extractFeatures script could be used to extract the old and new features from the data file. Store these features in a file featMat.csv in the same folder as the file touch.py.

In touch.py, we have separate functions to print out the mutual information, correlations and using the selected features from any of the scenarios to train and evaluate a classifier. 

To view the mutual information, correlations or the features selected using the scenarios as explained in the analysis file, uncomment the corresponding function and run the python script. 
To evaluate the classifier using the desired scenario, edit the get_F1_score() function to choose features from the desired scenario and the classifier of your choice. The comments in the function should be helpful for this. The sklearn toolkit enables cross validation without needing to write a separate function for that.
