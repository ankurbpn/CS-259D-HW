Number of sequences =  2500
Number of different commands =  635 635 635
Number of co-occurences of rm with ls for user 1 and 2 for the first 5 sequences are:
User 1:  0.0 1.0 3.0 1.0 1.0
User 2:  1.0 0.0 0.0 0.0 0.0
We chose exact mean centering (destroys sparsity of the training matrix)
Centered correlation of rm with ls for user 1 and 2 for the first 5 sequences are:
User 1:  -0.7176 0.2824 2.2824 0.2824 0.2824
User 2:  0.2824 -0.7176 -0.7176 -0.7176 -0.7176

The contribution ratio is computed as a ratio of contribution of a component to the contribution of top 200 components since computing more components was taking too much time.

Based on the contribution ratios, we choose the number of principal components that explain around 90% of the variance observed in the top 200 components. The value was found to be 33.

Therefore, the dimension of our reduced space will be 33.
