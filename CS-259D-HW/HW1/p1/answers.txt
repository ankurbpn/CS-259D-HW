Storm botnet:

a) Estimates for the number of infected machines range between 250,000 to 1 million in the middle of 2007. (1) Its purposes include spam mail and denial of service attacks. (1) The amount of traffic is estimated at megabits/s oven hundreds of gigabits/s. (2)

b) The bots poll for updates and commands by maintaining a distributed hash table. Each bot periodically queries the network for a random key in a small set of possible keys. One of those keys will be found in the DHT, and will map to an encrypted URL, which the bot will decrypt and download over HTTP. (3)

c) A user receives spam email, and through good social engineering downloads and executes the initial stage of the implant served to them as a trojan.

Pseudocode (4) (5)
------------------
stage0: 
Generate unique ID for this host.
Attempt to connect to hardcoded list of peers.
if successful:
    Query peers for own ID. (This puts the host in the lists of its peers)

    Query peers for a key mapping to a URL used to download stage-two executable.

    if successful:
        Stage 2 executable downloads spam tool, email virus spreader, and DDoS tool

        Host polls every 2 hours for C&C

     else:
         generate new ID and goto stage0
else:
    quit

d) The primary infection vector for the Storm botnet is well crafted and topical emails with infectious attachments, or links to compromised or spoofed websites that serve the stage0 executable as a trojan. Examples include luring users to fake free music sites and embedding a malicious URL into greeting cards. (6) 

If a single machine or a subnet of machines are infected by the Storm trojan, then a simple clean reinstall of all computers in the subnet from their backup images will remove the trojan. 


e) The replication protocol relies only on spam email and good social engineering, not on any OS or networking exploits. This is only mitigated by educating users or by only allowing emails from whitlisted addresses or web requests to whitelisted domain names. The whitelisting approach will not mitigate all risk, as a whitelisted email address or website may be compromised and used to host the malware.

The C&C functionality can be prevented by classifying and filtering out traffic matching the Overnet P2P protocol.

f) In 2008 Microsoft took credit for removing a significant number of infected machines from the network using its Malicious Software Removal Tool. (7) Others speculate that the creators of Storm ceased development on it to instead focus on a second iteration of the malware. (8)
